Efficient order management is crucial for any e-commerce business. At RTCommerce, we understand the challenges merchants face when dealing with orders, shipments, and fulfillment. That’s why we’re excited to introduce our latest module: the Admin Orders Grid Tracking Module for Adobe Commerce (Magento 2). This essential tool optimizes how you access tracking information, making it easier and more efficient than the default Adobe Commerce functionality.

## Why Orders Grid Tracking is Essential

Managing order tracking can be a time-consuming task, especially when you have to click through multiple screens and manually enter tracking numbers on various carrier websites. Our Admin Orders Grid Tracking Module simplifies this process by grabbing all tracking numbers associated with an order and displaying them directly on the Orders grid. This module also provides direct tracking links to the most used carriers (DHL, FedEx, UPS, USPS), allowing you to access detailed tracking information with just a single click.

## Key Features and Benefits

1. **Direct Tracking Number Display:** The module integrates seamlessly with your Adobe Commerce admin panel, displaying all tracking numbers associated with an order directly on the Orders grid. This eliminates the need to navigate through multiple screens, saving you valuable time.
2. **Linked Carrier Information:** Each tracking number is hyperlinked to the respective carrier’s website (DHL, FedEx, UPS, USPS), providing instant access to detailed shipment information. No more manual entry or additional clicks are needed.
3. **Improved Efficiency:** By consolidating all tracking information in one place, this module significantly enhances your order management efficiency. You can quickly and easily find the information you need, streamlining your workflow.
4. **Enhanced Customer Service:** Quick access to tracking details allows your customer service team to respond to inquiries faster and more accurately, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.
5. **Streamlined Fulfillment Process:** Your fulfillment team can easily monitor and manage shipments, ensuring timely deliveries and reducing the risk of errors.
6. **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with the user in mind, the module offers an intuitive and efficient interface, making it easy for anyone on your team to use without extensive training.
